Main aim of this project is to parse a list of rentals in order to extract the different features each listing. Data has been collected in the form of pdf files from AirBnB website.

After extracting features from pdf files, a dataframe has been created and transferred to a csv file. Then data is cleaned like removing null values, converting string to integers , removing string from columns.

For further analysis few graphs have been plotted and a recommendation engine has been created which would take input from user and filter listings as per their request.
